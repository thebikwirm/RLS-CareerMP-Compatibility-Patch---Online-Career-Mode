# Changelog

## v1.0.0-beta.19

### Changed

- Rebased the compatibility builder and documentation for `RLS Career Overhaul 2.6.7` and `CareerMP v0.0.37`.
- The generated compatible RLS zip is now `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`.
- Updated the visible CareerMP player-list marker to `RLS CareerMP Patch v1.0.0-beta.19`.

### Notes

- The public RLS GitHub release feed still reports `v2.6.5` as latest on 2026-06-22, so builders targeting `2.6.7` must provide their own original `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7.zip` archive from the current RLS distribution source.
- The existing online compatibility fixes from beta18 are preserved.

## v1.0.0-beta.18

### Changed

- Added RaceTab and CareerMP Tablet 0.0.5 to the ready-to-use server bundle.
- Updated the visible CareerMP player-list marker to `RLS CareerMP Patch v1.0.0-beta.18`.

### Fixed

- Guarded early `MPConfig.getNickname()` calls in `careerMPEnabler.lua` and `careerMPPlayerPayments.lua`.
- Fixes the load-order crash where RaceTab/CareerMP could fail before BeamMP exposed `MPConfig`, then the BeamMP UI cascaded into `MPCoreNetwork.getLoginState()` nil fatal errors.

## v1.0.0-beta.17

### Changed

- Rebased the stable compatibility builder for `RLS Career Overhaul 2.6.6` and `CareerMP v0.0.37`.
- The generated compatible RLS zip is now `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.6_careermp_compatible.zip`.
- Kept the beta16 CareerMP wrapper handling, manual queue/resync controls, save-timing guards, traffic, workshop, drag, cargo, camera, and grey-orb mitigations on the new RLS base.

## v1.0.0-beta.16

### Changed

- Rebased the stable compatibility builder for `RLS Career Overhaul 2.6.5.4` and `CareerMP v0.0.37`.
- The generated compatible RLS zip is now `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.5.4_careermp_compatible.zip`.
- The builder now accepts the full `CareerMP_v0.0.37.zip` package and extracts its nested `Resources/Client/CareerMP.zip` before applying client patches.
- Kept the beta15 online job/freeroam save-timing guards while applying the existing traffic, workshop, drag, cargo, camera, queue, and resync fixes to the new bases.

### Fixed

- Fixed the default 7-Zip staging path used by the builder so large RLS zips with deep paths can fall back safely to Python ZIP output when 7-Zip fails on Windows.

## v1.0.0-beta.15

### Fixed

- Deferred immediate `career_saveSystem.saveCurrent()` calls from RLS BeamEats, freeroam race completion, and mission start/stop callbacks while running in BeamMP/CareerMP sessions.
- Restored the safer RLS 2.6.4 MP behavior for those job/freeroam-event save timing points, without disabling normal single-player autosaves.
- Marked mission start handling complete immediately online when the autosave is deferred, avoiding mission-start stalls while preventing mid-sync save callbacks.

### Notes

- This targets reports where jobs/freeroam events desync or fail on later attempts after completion/reward cleanup.
- The fix is intentionally narrow and does not disable garage, tuning, repair, insurance, marketplace, business, or general career saves.

## v1.0.0-beta.14

### Fixed

- Added a manual `Force Re-Sync Vehicles` action to the CareerMP player list for recovering stale/desynced remote vehicles without bringing back unsafe automatic queue applies.
- Added a server-side stability hotfix script that cleans all stale `vehicleStates` owned by a player when they leave, crash, reconnect, or are manually force-resynced.
- Guarded CareerMP server JSON/event sends so bad payloads or disconnected player IDs do not cascade into server restarts during 3+ player sessions.
- Hardened client vehicle sync handling so malformed state packets are ignored and remote vehicle cleanup only happens when the server explicitly requests a force resync.
- Kept Prop Cargo owner-only online and documented that shared/half-synced turn-ins are intentionally blocked for stability.

### Notes

- This build should be tested locally before publishing. Do not call it stable until the two-player resync, three-player leave/crash, and owner-only cargo tests pass.
- Missing `Force Re-Sync Vehicles` or the `v1.0.0-beta.14` marker means stale cached `CareerMP.zip` files are still being loaded.

## v1.0.0-beta.13

### Fixed

- Removed the late-join auto-queue apply pass from the CareerMP player list. Queue/restore buttons are still available, but queued vehicle changes must now be applied manually so remote vehicle edits are not forced while another player is driving.
- Added a visible `RLS CareerMP Patch v1.0.0-beta.13` marker to the CareerMP player list and a `rls_careermp_patch_version.txt` marker inside `CareerMP.zip` to help identify stale cached client files.
- Hardened cargo loading so failed or timed-out cargo container updates always continue safely and unfreeze the vehicle instead of leaving the car unusable after a delivery.
- Marked Prop Cargo tasks as owner-only in multiplayer. The player who accepted/spawned the prop cargo owns the turn-in flow; other clients should not try to complete half-synced prop cargo tasks.
- Added local drag-session ownership guards so remote drag display/light sync no longer overwrites a client that already has its own local drag race active.
- Fixed RLS drag override loading so `gameplay_drag_utils` is recognized correctly when the RLS override system is active, restoring free-drag lights/start behavior online.
- Hardened Alder Dragway abort/retry cleanup so stale removed opponent vehicles no longer crash `dragAiCompat` and RLS free drag continues working after abandoning a drag mission.
- Reset RLS drag practice state, HUD, traffic, and drag data safely when a drag mission is stopped, abandoned, disqualified, or fails mid-phase.

### Notes

- Modded vehicles and trailer extension mods can still be incompatible with RLS/CareerMP, but this build is designed to fail safely and log the vehicle/job context instead of killing the active vehicle.
- Validated in the West Coast test server: RLS free drag started, Alder Dragway started with a new opponent, abandoning Alder no longer blocks the next RLS free-drag attempt.
- Old player list UI or no `v1.0.0-beta.13` marker usually means stale BeamMP client cache files are still loaded. Clear cached server mods before rejoining.

## v1.0.0-beta.12

### Changed

- Rebased the compatibility builder and RLS overlay for `RLS Career Overhaul 2.6.5.2`.
- Preserved the new RLS `2.6.5.2` vehicle maintenance and racing team modules while keeping the existing CareerMP compatibility fixes.
- The release builder now names the generated compatible RLS zip from the source archive, so `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.5.2.zip` generates `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.5.2_careermp_compatible.zip`.
- The builder now patches the RLS mod metadata filename dynamically instead of carrying a stale `mod_info` overlay from an older RLS version.

## v1.0.0-beta.11

### Fixed

- Added an online-safe RLS drag timer override so multiplayer drag timeslips no longer report roughly double ET while trap speed remains correct.
- The drag timer now ignores duplicated post-launch distance samples in BeamMP/CareerMP sessions and derives elapsed ET from real vehicle movement after the launch beam is crossed.
- Hardened the Alder Dragway NPC startup path so registered drag opponents are forced back to vanilla vehicle AI before staging/countdown/race commands are sent.
- Keeps the freeroam drag POI/runtime alive after a race finishes while still resetting race state immediately, so second and later Alder runs can trigger again without relogging.
- Reapplies the drag NPC compatibility wrapper after BeamNG reloads `gameplay_drag_utils`, so second and later runs keep the same AI fix as the first run.
- Force-clears the RLS freeroam drag session flags after a drag finish so the career POI system can show and trigger the staging marker again.
- Wraps drag start detection and `startDragRaceActivity` to clear stale started/completed flags and reacquire the display/timer modules on every run.
- Kept the fix RLS-side only so normal single-player drag timing remains untouched.
- Restored BeamMP queue/restore controls inside the CareerMP player list and added a rate-limited late-join auto-queue pass so vehicles that existed before joining no longer stay as black/grey orbs.

## v1.0.0-beta.10

### Fixed

- Fixed Prop Cargo deliveries that routed correctly but would not turn in when the physical prop reached the destination.
- Prop Cargo now confirms automatically after the prop stays inside the destination radius for a short moment instead of requiring the player to leave the drop-off area and re-enter a vehicle.
- Batched Prop Cargo turn-ins by destination and guarded the reward confirmation flow so multiple props cannot drop a second confirmation while the previous reward popup is still active.

## v1.0.0-beta.9

### Fixed

- Fixed RLS drag events in online CareerMP sessions where the opponent NPC spawned at Alder Dragway but would not drive into staging or start the race.
- Kept the drag runtime stack warm during world load so drag strip lights, staging logic, timeslips, and drag payout hooks are available before the event starts.
- Prevented the RLS vehicle-side `overrideAI` from being installed on registered drag racer vehicles, preserving the vanilla drag AI command flow used by `ai.setTarget`, `ai.setSpeed`, and launch staging.

### Validated

- Rebuilt both generated zips and validated the generated RLS archive with `zipfile.testzip()`.
- Confirmed the dedicated West Coast multiplayer test server loaded the updated RLS zip and CareerMP zip successfully.
- Manual smoke test passed: the Alder Dragway opponent NPC staged and the drag event started correctly in the online CareerMP session.

## v1.0.0-beta.8

### Fixed

- Added a multiplayer-safe RLS speed/red-light camera override so speed cameras can issue fines again without crashing when traffic data is missing or AI traffic is disabled.
- Hardened CareerMP speed/red-light notifications so nil vehicles, missing model data, or missing traffic signal timers no longer crash the client.
- Kept the RLS drag practice runtime loaded in CareerMP sessions, restoring the dependency used by drag strip lights, dragstrip freeroam events, and tuning shop drag jobs.
- Added a parcel loading timeout fallback so delivery commits do not hang forever if BeamMP does not return the vehicle cargo-container callback.
- Added defensive prop cargo dependency refreshes so prop delivery can recover when the module is loaded before all career delivery modules are ready.
- Forced full remote vehicle rendering in the CareerMP client patch to avoid grey placeholder orbs for players, walking beamlings/unicycles, and parked vehicles on late join.
- Reduced remote ghost refresh spam and explicitly syncs the walking unicycle inactive when a player enters a vehicle, helping prevent the beamling from staying behind.

### Validated

- Rebuilt both generated zips and validated the final archives with `zipfile.testzip()`.
- Confirmed the generated RLS zip includes the new safe `speedTraps.lua`, no longer unloads `gameplay_drag_dragTypes_dragPracticeRace`, still removes the legacy minimap override, and includes the cargo fallback changes.
- Confirmed the generated CareerMP zip includes the safe camera notification path, forced full remote rendering, and still removes the old `careermp.uilayout.json` preset.

## v1.0.0-beta.7

### Fixed

- Added an RLS `overrides/career/modules/tuning.lua` compatibility override so multiplayer tuning no longer crashes on `getObjectByID(nil)` after applying changes.
- Reacquired the tuned vehicle after respawn instead of continuing to use stale pre-respawn vehicle references during the tuning apply flow.
- Added multiplayer-safe tuning UI exit handling so backing out of the tuning screen no longer leaves players stuck inside a frozen vehicle.
- Reset tuning session state on close and after save completion so repeated tuning sessions can confirm purchases reliably instead of inheriting stale shopping state.

### Validated

- Validated the West Coast multiplayer tuning flow on the dedicated all-fixes test server: first tuning apply, confirm purchase, reopen tuning, and repeat tuning purchase all completed successfully in the final tested build.

## v1.0.0-beta.6

### Fixed

- Consolidated this compatibility update so the generated patch set now covers both the multiplayer traffic-disable regression and the workshop respawn/recovery/taxi regression in one release step.
- Patched the RLS `overrides/career/modules/playerDriving.lua` traffic setup path so CareerMP servers with `roadTrafficEnabled=false` and `parkedTrafficEnabled=false` no longer get forced fallback spawns.
- Fixed the RLS career traffic bootstrap interpreting `trafficAmount = 0` and `trafficParkedAmount = 0` as auto-spawn values during multiplayer startup.
- Disabled the extra default police traffic pool when the CareerMP server traffic config turns road traffic off, preventing the common `2 traffic + 2 parked` fallback case.
- Added inventory and workshop compatibility guards so a tuned vehicle no longer gets treated as AI traffic after respawn and stale vehicle references no longer break recovery or taxi actions.

### Validated

- Rebuilt both generated release zips and started a dedicated West Coast no-traffic test server with `roadTrafficEnabled=false`, `roadTrafficAmount=0`, `parkedTrafficEnabled=false`, and `parkedTrafficAmount=0`.
- Validated the workshop flow on a West Coast multiplayer test server: applying a tune, opening recovery with `R`, taking a taxi to a garage, and taking a taxi back to the last vehicle all completed without the previous softlock or `recoverPrompt` crash.

## v1.0.0-beta.5

### Fixed

- Patched both RLS insurance module paths (`career/modules` and `overrides/career/modules`) so multiplayer uses the repaired logic regardless of which path BeamNG loads first.
- Replaced broken multiplayer `Instant` repair handling with a safe `2 sec` repair flow to avoid charging players without actually repairing the vehicle.
- Fixed the repair screen so the displayed repair time matches the backend repair value in multiplayer sessions.
- Fixed the garage repair callback so repaired vehicles return to the garage flow correctly instead of leaving players inside the damaged vehicle.
- Fixed delayed repair handoff to use the current inventory vehicle reference instead of the stale pre-repair vehicle reference.

### Validated

- West Coast multiplayer repair flow now completes successfully: payment, repair, and garage return all worked in the validated test build.

## v1.0.0-beta.4

### Fixed

- CareerMP now passes the active multiplayer level into the RLS career startup call, preventing River Highway sessions from falling back to `west_coast_usa`.
- The generated `CareerMP.zip` now removes the legacy `careermp.uilayout.json` preset to avoid `ui/apps.lua` nil layout crashes on BeamNG 0.34.

### Validated

- River Highway multiplayer smoke test passed for loading, minimap, rejoin, map integrity, and garage/computer interaction.

## v1.0.0-beta.3

### Added

- Added a builder-only River Highway compatibility workflow.
- Added `build_river_highway_delta.py` to generate the River delta zip from user-provided original archives.
- Added a River manifest and small overlay package for daylight startup, career map loading, forest cleanup, texture/material aliases, and floating West Coast object cleanup.
- Added beginner-friendly River Highway build and server setup documentation.

### Changed

- Builders now preserve other files in the output directory instead of deleting the entire `built` folder.

## v1.0.0-beta.2

### Fixed

- Removed the legacy RLS minimap app override during release builds to prevent `ui_apps_minimap_minimap` nil crashes after rejoining.
- Synced CareerMP road and parked traffic settings to BeamNG runtime settings so server-side traffic disable flags are enforced on clients.
- Added a runtime traffic guard that keeps AI traffic and parked traffic disabled when the CareerMP server config turns them off.

### Upgrade Notes

- Servers updating from `v1.0.0-beta.1` must replace both generated release zips: the RLS compatible zip fixes the minimap, and the generated `CareerMP.zip` fixes traffic config enforcement.

## v1.0.0-beta.1

### Added

- Compatibility between the `career_careerMP` entrypoint and the RLS-overhauled career implementation.
- Reintroduced `propCargo.lua` for RLS `2.6.5.1`.
- Prop cargo card flow in `cargoScreen.lua`.
- `propCargo` filter support in `cargoCards.lua`.
- `build_release.py` script for generating the final release zips from the original mod archives.

### Changed

- Updated `extensionManager.lua` so it no longer disables `multiplayerbeammp`.
- Updated `careerMPEnabler.lua` so it also responds to `onComputerMenuOpened`.
- Updated `computer.lua` so the computer tether is cleared when moving into submenus or closing the menu.
- Updated `mod_info/RLSCO24/info.json` to identify the compatible variant.

### Fixed

- RLS only loading through `career_career` and not through `career_careerMP`.
- Missing prop cargo support in the `2.6.5.1` port.
- Incorrect `CareerMP.zip` packaging that prevented `modScript.lua` from loading.
- Hook mismatch between the RLS computer menu and `CareerMP`.

### Pending Final Validation

- Full online tuning, painting, and part-shopping flow after the computer tether cleanup.
