# Beginner Setup Guide

If you are new to this project, start here.

## The Most Important Thing

Most users do **not** need Python.

You only need Python if **you are the person generating the compatible zip files** from the original mods.

If a server owner, friend, or Discord post already gave you these finished files:

- `CareerMP.zip`
- `CareerMPBanking.zip`
- `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`
- `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`
- `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`
- `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`

then you can skip the Python part completely.

## Option A: I Just Want To Play

If someone already gave you the finished compatible files:

1. Install:
- `CareerMP.zip`
- `CareerMPBanking.zip`
- `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`
- `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`
- `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`
- `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`

2. Do **not** also install:
- `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7.zip`
- `RLS_2.6.4_MPv3.8.zip`

3. Launch BeamNG / BeamMP and join the server.

That is it.

No Python is needed for this.

## Option B: I Want To Host A Server

For a normal West Coast setup, the server should use:

- `CareerMP.zip`
- `CareerMPBanking.zip`
- `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`
- `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`
- `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`
- `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`

Use only the compatible RLS zip, not the original RLS zip.

If you want traffic fully disabled on your server:

- replace **both** generated files, not just `CareerMP.zip`
- set `roadTrafficEnabled` to `false`
- set `parkedTrafficEnabled` to `false`
- set `roadTrafficAmount` to `0`
- set `parkedTrafficAmount` to `0`
- set `autoUpdate` to `false` in the CareerMP server config so the patched files do not get overwritten later

The current compatibility update bundles two fixes together:

- the traffic-disable fix for servers that want `roadTrafficEnabled=false` / `parkedTrafficEnabled=false`
- the workshop compatibility fix for tune and part-shopping flows that could otherwise leave the player vehicle in AI traffic or break recovery / taxi
- the multiplayer camera, drag, parcel delivery, and grey-orb fixes
- the beta19 manual queue/resync fix, cargo fail-safe unfreeze, drag abort cleanup, save-timing guard, RaceTab/Tablet bundle, BeamMP load-order guard, and visible UI version marker

Because those fixes are split between both generated files, update both zips together.

## Option C: I Need To Build The Files Myself

You only need this section if you do **not** already have the finished compatible zips.

You will need:

- the original `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7.zip`
- the original `CareerMP_v0.0.37.zip`
- Python installed on Windows

`CareerMP_v0.0.37.zip` can be the full package with `Resources\Client\CareerMP.zip` inside. The builder extracts the client zip automatically.

Useful URLs:

- RLS public releases: https://github.com/RLS-Modding/rls_career_overhaul/releases
- CareerMP v0.0.37 package: https://github.com/StanleyDudek/CareerMP/releases/download/v0.0.37/CareerMP_v0.0.37.zip
- This compatibility project releases: https://github.com/ChiarelloB/RLS-CareerMP-Compatibility-Patch---Online-Career-Mode/releases

Note: GitHub's public RLS release feed still reports `v2.6.5` as latest on 2026-06-22. If you are building the `2.6.7` compatible package, use your current original `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7.zip` from the RLS distribution source you already have access to.

Then run:

```powershell
python .\scripts\build_release.py --rls-original "C:\path\to\rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7.zip" --careermp-original "C:\path\to\CareerMP_v0.0.37.zip" --out-dir ".\built"
```

If `python` does not work, try:

```powershell
py .\scripts\build_release.py --rls-original "C:\path\to\rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7.zip" --careermp-original "C:\path\to\CareerMP_v0.0.37.zip" --out-dir ".\built"
```

The script will create:

- `built\rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`
- `built\CareerMP.zip`

## Add-on Maps

RLS add-on maps usually work by stacking the add-on map zip on top of the base compatible RLS setup.

That means:

- `CareerMP.zip`
- `CareerMPBanking.zip`
- `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`
- `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`
- `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`
- `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`
- the RLS add-on map zip you want to use

Example:

- `rls_career_overhaul_italy_2.1.zip`

River Highway is a special case and needs its own extra compatibility delta.

## River Highway

River Highway is **not** the simple setup.

It needs:

- `CareerMP.zip`
- `CareerMPBanking.zip`
- `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`
- `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`
- `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`
- `rls_career_overhaul_2.6.7_careermp_compatible.zip`
- `River_Highway_Rework_PHI.zip`
- `rls_career_overhaul_river_highway_beta_0.0.5_careermp_delta.zip`

The River delta is builder-only and is covered in the main README.

## Prop Cargo: How It Works

`Prop Cargo` is not turned in the same way as normal parcel cards.

Basic flow:

1. Start a `Prop Cargo` delivery from the cargo screen.
2. Physical props will spawn at the pickup area.
3. Move those props to the destination.
4. When the prop reaches the destination area, get back into a vehicle and move away a little.
5. The drop-off should then confirm automatically.

Important:

- Prop Cargo is owner-only online.
- The same player who accepted/spawned the prop cargo should be the one to deliver it.
- Other players may see parts of the job, but they should not be treated as the owner of the turn-in.

## How To Know You Have The New CareerMP Zip

Open the CareerMP player list in-game.

The newest build should show:

```text
RLS CareerMP Patch v1.0.0-beta.19
```

If you do not see that marker, your client is probably still using old cached files.

Fix:

- close BeamNG
- clear the old downloaded BeamMP/server mod cache for this server
- make sure the server has the newest `CareerMP.zip`
- rejoin and check the marker again

Also important:

- vehicle queue/sync actions are manual in beta19
- right-click a player and use `Queue Events` only when you actually want to apply queued vehicle changes
- right-click a player and use `Force Re-Sync Vehicles` if their remote vehicles are stuck/desynced after a leave, crash, or reconnect
- do not expect queued changes to auto-apply while someone is driving

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Installing the original RLS zip together with the compatible RLS zip.
- Thinking Python is required even when the finished compatible files are already provided.
- Using old `2.6.4` multiplayer RLS files together with the new compatible build.
- Forgetting `CareerMPBanking.zip`, `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`, `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`, or `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`.
- Not checking the `RLS CareerMP Patch v1.0.0-beta.19` marker after updating.
- For River Highway, installing the original old River RLS beta together with the generated River delta.

## If Something Still Does Not Work

Check these first:

- Are you using the generated compatible RLS zip, not the original one?
- Did you also install `CareerMPBanking.zip`?
- Did you also install `CareerMPPartySharedVehicles.zip`, `rls_RaceTab_Release.zip`, and `CareerMP-Tablet-0.0.5.zip`?
- If using an add-on map, did you keep the base compatible RLS zip installed too?
- If using River Highway, are you using the PHI map and the generated River delta, not the original old River beta by itself?
- If traffic is supposed to be off, did you replace both generated zips and not only `CareerMP.zip`?
- If tune, recovery, or taxi still breaks after a workshop change, did you replace both generated zips and not only one of them?
- If speed cameras, drag jobs, Alder aborts, parcel delivery, or grey player/parked-car orbs still happen, did you replace both generated zips from the newest build?
- If old UI, missing force resync, instant vehicle sync, or `MPCoreNetwork.getLoginState()` fatal errors still happen, does the CareerMP player list show `RLS CareerMP Patch v1.0.0-beta.19`?
- If players desync after someone leaves/crashes, did the server owner run `scripts\apply_server_hotfix.py` on the BeamMP server folder?
- If traffic is still wrong on a server, is `autoUpdate` turned off in the CareerMP server config?

If you are still stuck, send:

- a screenshot of your mod list
- the map name you are trying to use
- whether you are using ready-made files or building with Python
- the exact error message
